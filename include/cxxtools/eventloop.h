    /** @brief Thread-safe event loop supporting I/O multiplexing and Timers.

        The System EventLoop can be used as the central entity of a thread or
        process to dispatch application events and wait on multiple IODevices or
        Timers for activity.

        Events can be added to the internal event queue, even from other threads
        using the method EventLoop::commitEvent or EventLoop::queueEvent. The
        first method will add the event to the internal queue and wake the
        event loop, the latter allows queing multiple events and it is up to
        the caller to wake the event loop by calling EventLoop::wake when all
        events are added. When the event loop processes its event, the signal
        "event" is send for each processed event. Events are processes in the
        order they were added.

        To start the %EventLoop the method EventLoop::run must be executed. It blocks
        until the event loop is stopped. To stop the %EventLoop, EventLoop::exit
        must be called. The delivery of the events occurs inside the thread that
        started the execution of the event loop.

        %IODevices and %Timers can be added to an %EventLoop just as to Selector.
        In fact a %Selector is used internally to implement the %EventLoop.

        Since the %EventLoop is a Runnable, it can be easily assigned to a thread
        to give it its own event loop.
